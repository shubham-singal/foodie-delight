Instructions on How to Run:** Due to Chrome's Same-Site cookie issues, I recommend you to clone this repository and run it locally instead of using the remote server.
After cloning the repository, enter `npm install` in command line. Then `npm start`

Repeat the same steps for server, the github repo link for server is: https://github.com/shubham-singal/foodie-delight-server

Before running the application visit the following link and click the "request temporary access button"
